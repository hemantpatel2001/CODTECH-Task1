To Do List JavaScript Project
This project implements a simple To Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, while persisting the tasks locally using localStorage.

Features
Add New To Do: Users can input a task and add it to the list by clicking the "Add" button.
Edit Existing To Do: Tasks can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button on any task, modifying the text, and then clicking "Edit" again to save changes.
Delete To Do: Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking the "Remove" button.
Local Storage: All tasks are stored locally using localStorage, ensuring tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:

index.html: Contains the structure and basic elements of the To Do List, including input fields, buttons, and the task list.
style.css: Defines the styles and layout for the To Do List, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
script.js: Implements the functionality of the To Do List, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as managing local storage operations.

How to Use
Adding a Task: Type a task into the input field and click "Add".
Editing a Task: Click the "Edit" button next to a task, modify the text in the input field, and click "Edit" again to save changes.
Deleting a Task: Click the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it from the list.
Persistence: All tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, so they will persist across sessions until explicitly deleted.
